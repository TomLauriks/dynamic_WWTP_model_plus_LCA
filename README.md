# dynamic_WWTP_model_plus_LCA
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that generates life cycle assessment (LCA) results (both classical and dynamic results), from the output of the dynamic Eindhoven wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) model.

The notebook's filename is dynamicModellingPlusLCA_notebook.ipynb. It is accompanied by a Python script that contains two functions. Both can be viewed by clicking on them. The notebook is well documented and provided with clarifications for the interested reader. The whole repository is also available to download.

If one intends to download the repository, note that the map structure is the one like it is defined in the notebook. The map "results" is used to write out all generated plots. The map "data" and its submaps contain the input data the notebook requires. Some short versions of data sets - shorter than the ones I used for scenario analysis - are provided that can be used for generating results. The full simulation results are too big to upload on GitHub. Feel free to contact me if you need the dataset that I used for scenario analysis. The map "figures" contains the figure displayed in the notebook. The map "misc" contains the data that is used in the appendix. Starting instruction can be found in the section "Roadmap through this notebook".

A closing remark is at its place. This notebook is the practical work that accompanied my master thesis. The primary goal of my thesis was to investigate whether or not dynamic LCA is useful. As a consequence, the LCA part was not as thorough as an LCA should be. One major reason for this, is that the WWTP model is not intended to be coupled to an LCA and as is to be expected, a lot of data that should be included into the LCA is not part of the modelling results. In my opinion, my thesis demonstrates that dynamic LCA can be very useful. However, a lot of work needs to be done in order to get good LCA results from dynamic WWTP modelling. Pleas keep that in mind when using this notebook.
